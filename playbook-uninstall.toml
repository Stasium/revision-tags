## How to uninstall ReviOS

### Note:
‚ö†Ô∏è„Ä°This **will not** remove ReviOS fully, only most of it!
‚ö†Ô∏è„Ä°This **will not** bring back removed APPX packages or revert registry modifications, only system components!
üìó„Ä°To completely remove ReviOS, you **will** need to reinstall Windows!

To uninstall, open a new PowerShell window as administrator and paste the following command:
```powershell
Get-WindowsPackage -online -PackageName *ReviOS* | Remove-WindowsPackage -Online
```
If the command completes without any errors, restart your PC. ReviOS should now be (mostly) removed.
