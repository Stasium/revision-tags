**Common bluetooth detection/connection issue fix**
Fix: Likely missing `bthtelemetry.dll`

1. Visit https://winbindex.m417z.com/, in the search bar, type "`bthtelemetry.dll`", select the only option that comes up
2. Select one of the versions (doesnâ€™t matter) and download the file with the button to the right
3. A file will be downloaded under a weird looking name like "B0F0271C323726418D2D827AF57E7455954AB6E2051F0CF6DDE469BAEE23540300.blob" 
4. In file explorer, change the name of the file and its extension to bthtelemetry.dll.
5. Move the file to C:\\Windows\\System32
6. Restart
