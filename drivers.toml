You **need** to **install the drivers** related to the hardware that is not working. See the guide on the [**How to install drivers**](https://revi.cc/docs/setup/drivers) page of the FAQ.

It's generally recommended to **not** use Windows Update or any driver installer tool for this task. They can install outdated drivers or drivers that are not compatible with your hardware.
