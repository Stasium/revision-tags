**Does ReviOS increase FPS?**

ReviOS removes or disables resource-heavy drivers, services, and background tasks, such as ReadyBoost and Windows Defender, or similar features that may impact performance. This optimization can help improve overall system responsiveness, and you might notice a slight increase in average FPS, as well as in 1% and 0.1% lows.

**However, it's important to note** that ReviOS is not a magic solution for dramatically increasing FPS. It reduces system bloat rather than enhancing your hardware's performance, so any improvements in FPS will likely be modestâ€”just a few extra frames. You can also expect gains in system stability, lower latency, and better privacy.

For a full list of what ReviOS removes or disables, you can check this link: [ReviOS Features List](https://revi.cc/docs/faq/before/features).

If you're looking for a significant FPS boost, upgrading your hardware will have the biggest impact.
